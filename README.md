# EasyHUD
EasyHUD is a plugin that provides what most projects end up doing
with their AHUD class; it turns it into a widget manager that spawns
a predefined set of widgets.

## How to Use
1. Create a Blueprint class deriving from EasyHudBase.
2. Add the Widget Blueprint class references you want to spawn to the
relevant sections.
3. Set your gamemode to use your newly created Blueprint.
4. Enjoy your UMG widgets being magically spawned with your game.
